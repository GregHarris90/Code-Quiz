# Technology-Used

- To build this application I used html, css, and javascript while using the WebAPIs to make a Coding Quiz Game for users to play!

# User-Story

- Once "Start" button is pushed, a timer will start and the user will be asked a series of questions. 

- For every wrong answer 10 seconds will be taken off your timer, if timer hits 0 the game ends.

- For every correct answer the user earns a point for their score.

- If a player gets through the questions then they can save their score under their initials/name. 

- Then they can restart the game or view their highscore.

- After viewing score the user can also clear their saved name/score, go back, and play again!

# Conclusion

### 01/21/21

- Just like last week I'll be turning in this assignment as incomplete. I'm still having a lot of trouble putting everything together with JavaScript. 

- I've touched base with a tutor and will be finding a time to go over these last two sections (JavaScript/Web-APIs) to better understand them. 

- I feel like it's all slowly making more sense as I continue to work through these projects, but I still wasn't able to get everything done in time. 

*I will continue working on this until I get it working!*

### 01/22/21 (EDIT)

- Spent Friday going over these last few sections(JavaScript/Web-APIs) and doing some review. Then continued work on my Code Quiz Challenge. 

- I was finally able to get my questions to show up once the game starts and the buttons to properly display the possible answers. 

- I still need to log the answers and create a couple more functions to get the highscore end-page to display and set game conditions for timer. 

*I will continue working on this until I get it working!*

### 05/28/21 (EDIT)

- With the Bootcamp coming to a close I was able to finally spend some time and return to this homework assignment. 

- I was able to finally finish the questions, score, all the button functions, and saving the user's initials into local storage.

- I'm really happy I was finally able to complete this project, applying everything that I've learned over these last few months, and will be requesting a regrade on it!
