- For every wrong answer 10 seconds will be taken off your timer, if timer hits 0 then you lose.

# Overall Conclusion

### 01/21/21

- Just like last week I'll be turning in this assignment as incomplete. I'm still having a lot of trouble putting everything together with JavaScript. 

- I've touched base with a tutor and will be finding a time to go over these last two sections (JavaScript/Web-APIs) to better understand them. 

- I feel like it's all slowly making more sense as I continue to work through these projects, but I still wasn't able to get everything done in time. 

*I will continue working on this until I get it working!*

### 01/22/21

- Spent Friday going over these last few sections(JavaScript/Web-APIs) and doing some reivew. Then continued work on my Code Quiz Challenge. 

- I was finally able to get my questions to show up once the game starts and the buttons to properly display the possible answers. 

- I still need to log the answers and create a couple more functions to get the highscore end-page to display and set game conditions for timer. 

*I will continue working on this until I get it working!*
