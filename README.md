# Overall Conclusion

### 01/21/21

- Just like last week I'll be turning in this assignment as incomplete. I'm still having a lot of trouble putting everything together with JavaScript. 

- I've touched base with a tutor and will be finding a time to go over these last two sections (JavaScript/Web-APIs) to better understand them. 

- I feel like it's all slowly making more sense as I continue to work through these projects, but I still wasn't able to get everything done in time. 

*I will continue working on this until I get it working!*
